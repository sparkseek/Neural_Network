Signal Classification using deep learning

• DOMAIN: Electronics and Telecommunication

• CONTEXT: A communications equipment manufacturing company has a product which is responsible for emitting informative signals. 
Company wants to build a machine learning model which can help the company to predict the equipment’s signal quality using various 
parameters. 

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality
   
• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To build a classifier which can use the given parameters to determine the signal strength or quality
